# Capacitor-Resistor-Classifier
This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify electronic components, specifically resistors and capacitors, using image data. The "Resistor vs. Capacitor Classifier" utilizes the TensorFlow framework and implements a deep learning architecture based on the MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network.
